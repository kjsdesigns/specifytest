## Validation Cases

<!--
This section is for listing related test and scenario cases.
Non-case specs (workflows, pages, UI components, etc.) should NOT reference
precondition cases. Only test cases and scenario cases should reference
precondition cases.

For pages and UI components: Test and scenario cases listed in embedded UI
components are indirectly inherited. Only list cases here that directly test
this spec's unique functionality.
